          <p>
            For a course like this, no single textbook will represent the course
            expectations well. However, what I will dois provide you weekly
            reading material (some of which will be mandatory) from other
            universities, and otherplaces from the web. This material will
            supplement well with what is taught in the class.

          <p>
            There are three assignments. You may be asked to work in pairs in
            some of these assignments. Please check theassignment handout for
            these details for the exact due date and whether you can work in
            groups or not. DO NOT EMAIL YOUR ASSIGNMENTS TO US. We will use
            MARKUS for the submission of all assignments. ALL ASSIGNMENTS WILL
            MARKED ON UTSC LAB MACHINES. IT IS IMPORTANT BEFORE SUBMITTING
            YOURASSIGNMENT, TO MAKE SURE THAT IT COMPILES AND EXECUTES ON THE
            UTSC LAB MACHINES. A STRICT silent policy takes effect 12 hours
            before an ASSIGNMENT or EXAM is due. This means no questionabout the
            assignment will be answered by the instructor or the TA whether it
            is asked on the bulletin board, byemail or in person. I will make
            sure to follow the due dates mentioned in the course syllabus,
            however, if the duedates on the assignment handout differ from this
            course syllabus handout, the due dates on the assignment handoutwill
            supersede.
